# PIC24 and dsPIC30 devices.
# Addresses and sizes are given in 32-bit words. This means that the program
# size should be specified as the number of instructions (each instruction being
# 24 bits of data and 8 0-bits).
# eeprom_address would typically be 3FFF00h (7FFE00h in the data sheets) and
# config_address is usually 7C0000h (F80000h in the data sheets). eeprom_size
# should be specified in the number of 2-byte words, as in the HEX file the
# words are also padded to 32 bits.
