Introduction
============

fpicprog is a software driver for FTDI USB chips like the FT232RL to program
Microchip PICâ„¢ chips. Contrary to other such software, fpicprog allows fast
programming and verification, by using the so-called Synchronous Bitbang mode
of the FT232RL and later chips. Programming several kilobytes of program data
takes seconds, where other FT232-based programming methods take minutes for
the same data.

USB-to-serial converters with the FT232RL are readily available over the
internet, often costing no more than a handful of dollars. These are typically
not in a housing, but instead provide a circuit board with a USB connector on
one end and a bare PCB header on the other. These are easily used with a
breadboard to connect the PCB header to the appropriate pins of the PIC chip.
Make sure however, that the converter uses the appropriate voltage for your
PIC chip. There are versions at 5V and at 3.3V.

Note that fpicprog is designed to work with chips which provide Low-Voltage
Programming, or Single-Supply programming. It is possible to use one of the
pins of the FT232 chip to drive a high voltage, and thereby also use fpicprog
for High-Voltage programming, but this requires extra circuitry which is not
described in this document.

Supported chips
===============

fpicprog supports chips in the following families: PIC10, PIC12, PIC16, PIC18
and PIC24. Most chips supporting Low-Voltage Programming from these families
can simply be added to the device database by copying the relevant parameters
from the datasheet. See the documentation in man/fpicprod-devlist.5.txt and the
device_db folder for more details.

Compiling fpicprog
==================

To compile fpicprog from the github repository, clone the gphalkes/fpicprog
and the gphalkes/makesys repositories in the same directory. Also make sure
you have the development package for libftdi (commonly called libftdi1-dev or
libftdi-devel) and the google-gflags development package installed. Then
run `make -C fpicprog/src COMPILER=gcc` to build fpicprog. Note that if clang++
is installed, the COMPILER=gcc can be left out to build with clang++ instead of
g++.

Connecting the programmer
=========================

Each PIC chip has a different pin layout, and there are different versions of
Low-Voltage programming, thus wiring up the chip will require checking the
datasheet for the chip you wish to program. However, in general you will need
to at least make the following connections: 

| Programmer  | Target | Remark |
| :---------: | :----: | :----- |
| VCC         | VDD    |
| GND         | VSS    |
| TxD         | !MCLR  |
| DTR         | PGC    |
| RxD         | PGD    |
| RTS         | PGD    | #1     |
| CTS         | PGM    | #2     |Only for non Low-Voltage Programming modes |

#1 A series resistor of approximately 470 ohms must be connected in series with 
the driving pin of the programmer module. Both the PIC and the programmer can 
drive the PGD pin at the same time resulting in a signal which operates in the
TTL indeterminate region. (Note: Increasing the PIC supply voltage is a possible
solution however, results in high driving currents and possible damage to either 
the target and/or programmer. Seperation of the signal is more recommended.)

#2 If the PIC chip you wish to program has a separate PGM pin, rather 
than activating the Low-Voltage Programming mode through a handshake on the 
!MCLR pin, you need to connect CTS -> PGM as well.

(Note that this is for the default settings. You can instruct fpicprog to use
different pins instead, if that make wiring easier.)

Although not strictly necessary, it is recommended to connect the !MCLR pin to
VCC using a pull-up resistor. You may also want to add capacitors between the
VDD and VSS pins as recommended by Microchip, although I have been able to
reliably program chips without any of these additional components.

An example of wiring up a PIC18F25K42 with the seperated PGD signal to a 
FT4232H Mini Module on Channel A can be seen in the picture 
"FT4232H_Mini_Module_Example.jpg" in the main project folder.

An example of wiring up a PIC18F45K50 is in the picture below. Note that the
order of the pins on the USB-to-serial converter is model dependent, so you will
have to check your specific board for the exact pin layout.
